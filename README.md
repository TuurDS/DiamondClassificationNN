# DiamondClassificationNN
This repository contains a neural network model for classifying diamonds based on their various attributes. The model is trained using a dataset of diamond samples with corresponding labels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of diamond samples, each labeled with a corresponding class. The dataset includes various attributes of the diamonds, such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions. The goal is to predict the class of a diamond based on these attributes.

##### NOTE: the datasets (.stl files) are not included in this repository because they are confidential.

## Voxelization algorithm
To voxelize our stl files we used a voxelization algorithm made by copederkoff
